Rock, Paper, Scissors project from The Odin Project


Here is my solution to the Rock, Paper, Scissors project from the Odin Project. It takes user input, compares it to the computer's choice and console logs the result.


I used nested if statements in this current version of the solution; however, I will be attempt other methods when returning to this project to add more features later in the course. 

I learned a ton in troubleshooting here, and console logging as you write to test whether the code is doing what you want it to be.
