Rock, Paper, Scissors project from The Odin Project


Here is my solution to the Rock, Paper, Scissors project from the Odin Project. It takes user input, compares it to the computer's choice, figures out the winner of the round, and tacks the score.

I am seeing how great breaking up the project into smaller parts and making your code modular is. Troubleshooting is much easier that way. 

I am really enjoying this project. I will be continually adding more features, styles, and characters to choose from. 

I learned a ton in troubleshooting, and on the benefits of console logging as you write to test whether the code is doing what you want it to be.
